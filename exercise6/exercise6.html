      <p id="p1">Most games have a winner and a loser, but
  fundamentally a cooperative game. The Dungeon
  Master (DM) plays the roles of the antagonists in the
  adventure, but the DM isn’t playing against the player
  characters (PCs). Although the DM represents all the
  PCs’ opponents and adversaries—monsters, nonplayer
  characters (NPCs), traps, and the like—he or she
  doesn’t want the player characters to fail any more
  than the other players do. The players all cooperate
  to achieve success for their characters. The DM’s goal
  is to make success taste its sweetest by presenting
  challenges that are just hard enough that the other
  players have to work to overcome them, but not so
  hard that they leave all the characters dead.
      </p>
      <p id="p2">
  At the table, having fun is the most important
  goal—more important than the characters’ success
  in an adventure. It’s just as vital for everyone at the
  table to cooperate toward making the game fun for
  everyone as it is for the player characters to cooperate
  within the adventure.
